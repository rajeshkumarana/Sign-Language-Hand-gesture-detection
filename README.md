# Sign Language Hand Gesture detection 
Sign Language Hand Gesture detection using Machine LearningðŸ‘‡
## Abstract
<p align="justify">
  Sign Language and gestures is an emerging topic in todayâ€™s technologies. The main focus of this is to recognize the human gestures using mathematical algorithms for human computer interaction. With the help of computers, we can communicate with the people who are having hearing impairment. Each of these communicating software has their own limitations when it comes to adapting more versatile hardware in computers. Gesture recognition is one of the essential techniques to build user-friendly interfaces. Usually gestures can be originated from any bodily motion or state, but commonly originate from the face or hand. Gesture recognition enables users to interact with the devices by identifying the actions performed by the user. This project describes how hand gestures are trained to perform certain actions to reflect the actions of the output given by the user. Gestures are used to give the input and the output is calculated.

## Project Description ðŸ“š
 - Sign Language is one of the most significant language who are hard-of-hearing.

           Our Goal is to enhance the existing system with more accurate result. With the implantation of TensorFlow Framework and Keras model for deep learning and training the model, the level of precision of the gesture detection has significantly improved. When an gesture is shown by the user the system responds and shows us with a probable amount of which gesture we are showing . <a href="http://ijsart.com/Home/IssueDetail/48859">Click Here</a> To Read More info in our journal Page.
